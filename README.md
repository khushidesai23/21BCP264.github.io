## Overview

This blog is a step-by-step tutorial on Dockerizing a three-tier application, including the presentation tier (frontend), application tier (backend), and database tier. It covers everything from crafting the frontend experience with React.js to fortifying the backend with Node.js and PostgreSQL, and finally orchestrating the containers with Docker Compose.

## Setup

To set up the three-tier application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khushidesai23/khushidesai23.github.io
    ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

 ```bash
   khushidesai23.github.io
 ```

3. Follow the instructions provided in each section of the blog post to Dockerize the frontend, backend, and database tiers.

## Usage:

Once the setup is complete, you can run the Docker containers locally to test the application. Use the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
Access the application in a web browser and test its functionality. Debug any issues that arise during testing.
